# Quant Stock Analysis â€” Starter

A clean, no-nonsense starter for a Stock Price Data Analysis project using Python, `yfinance`, and Jupyter Notebook. Perfect for a first-year quant project that shows data handling, time-series analysis, and plotting.

## What this does
- Pulls daily price data with `yfinance`
- Computes moving averages (SMA 20/50) and volatility
- Builds daily returns and a correlation matrix
- Plots normalized prices, SMAs, rolling volatility, and a correlation heatmap
- Saves tables and figures to the `output/` folder
